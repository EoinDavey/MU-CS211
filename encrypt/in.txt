A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin
and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and
butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often
frying with oil or butter. In Britain, pancakes are often unleavened and
resemble a crepe.[1] In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically
baking powder). American pancakes are similar to Scotch pancakes or drop
scones. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the
earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.[2]

The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. A crepe is a thin Breton
pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe
maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation
originating from southeast Europe is a palacinke, a thin moist pancake fried
on both sides and filled with jam, cheese cream, chocolate, or ground walnuts,
but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used. When potato is used
as a major portion of the batter, the result is a potato pancake. Commercially
prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries.

Pancakes may be served at any time of the day with a variety of toppings or
fillings including jam, fruit, syrup, chocolate chips, or meat, but in America
they are typically considered a breakfast food. Pancakes serve a similar
function to waffles. In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with
Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as "Pancake Day", when perishable ingredients
have to be used up before the fasting period of Lent.
